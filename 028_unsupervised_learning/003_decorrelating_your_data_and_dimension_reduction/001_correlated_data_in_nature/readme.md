# Correlated data in nature
You are given an array grains giving the width and length of samples of grain. You suspect that width and length will be correlated. To confirm this, make a scatter plot of width vs length and measure their Pearson correlation.

# Instructions
- Import:
- matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
- pearsonr from scipy.stats.
- Assign column 0 of grains to width and column 1 of grains to length.
- Make a scatter plot with width on the x-axis and length on the y-axis.
- Use the pearsonr() function to calculate the Pearson correlation of width and length.
