# Regression with categorical features
Having created the dummy variables from the 'Region' feature, you can build regression models as you did before. Here, you'll use ridge regression to perform 5-fold cross-validation.

The feature array X and target variable array y have been pre-loaded.

# Instructions
- Import Ridge from sklearn.linear_model and cross_val_score from sklearn.model_selection.
- Instantiate a ridge regressor called ridge with alpha=0.5 and normalize=True.
- Perform 5-fold cross-validation on X and y using the cross_val_score() function.
- Print the cross-validated scores.
