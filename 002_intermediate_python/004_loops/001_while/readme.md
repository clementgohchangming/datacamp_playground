# while: warming up
The while loop is like a repeated if statement. The code is executed over and over again, as long as the condition is True. Have another look at its recipe.

```python
while condition :
    expression
    ```

Can you tell how many printouts the following while loop will do?

```python
x = 1
while x < 4 :
    print(x)
    x = x + 1
```
