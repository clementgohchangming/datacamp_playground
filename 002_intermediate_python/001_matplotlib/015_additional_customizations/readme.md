# Additional Customizations
If you have another look at the script, under # Additional Customizations, you'll see that there are two `plt.text()` functions now. They add the words `"India"` and `"China"` in the plot.

# Instructions
- Add `plt.grid(True)` after the `plt.text()` calls so that gridlines are drawn on the plot.
