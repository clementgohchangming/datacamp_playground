# The next step
Before, you have already written Python code that determines the next step based on the previous step. Now it's time to put this code inside a for loop so that we can simulate a random walk.

# Instructions
- Make a list random_walk that contains the first step, which is the integer 0.
- Finish the for loop:
- The loop should run 100 times.
- On each iteration, set step equal to the last element in the random_walk list. You can use the index -1 for this.
- Next, let the if-elif-else construct update step for you.
- The code that appends step to random_walk is already coded.
- Print out random_walk.
