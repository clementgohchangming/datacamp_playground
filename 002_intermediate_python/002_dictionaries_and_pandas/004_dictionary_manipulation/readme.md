# Dictionary Manipulation (1)
If you know how to access a dictionary, you can also assign a new value to it. To add a new key-value pair to europe you can use something like this:

```python
europe['iceland'] = 'reykjavik'
```

# Instructions
- Add the key `'italy'` with the value `'rome'` to europe.
- To assert that `'italy'` is now a key in europe, print out `'italy'` in europe.
- Add another key:value pair to europe: `'poland'` is the key, `'warsaw'` is the corresponding value.
- Print out `europe`.
