# Customize further: elif
It's also possible to have a look around in the bedroom. The sample code contains an elif part that checks if room equals "bed". In that case, "looking around in the bedroom." is printed out.

It's up to you now! Make a similar addition to the second control structure to further customize the messages for different values of area.

# Instructions

- Add an elif to the second control structure such that "medium size, nice!" is printed out if area is greater than 10.
