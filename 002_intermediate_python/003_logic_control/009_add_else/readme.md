# Add else
On the right, the if construct for room has been extended with an else statement so that "looking around elsewhere." is printed if the condition room == "kit" evaluates to False.

Can you do a similar thing to add more functionality to the if construct for area?

# Instructions

- Add an else statement to the second control structure so that "pretty small." is printed out if area > 15 evaluates to False.
