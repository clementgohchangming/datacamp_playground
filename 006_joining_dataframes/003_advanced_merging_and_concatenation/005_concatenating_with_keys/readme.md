# Concatenating with keys
The leadership of the music streaming company has come to you and asked you for assistance in analyzing sales for a recent business quarter. They would like to know which month in the quarter saw the highest average invoice total. You have been given three tables with invoice data named inv_jul, inv_aug, and inv_sep. Concatenate these tables into one to create a graph of the average monthly invoice total.

# Instructions
- Concatenate the three tables together vertically in order with the oldest month first, adding '7Jul', '8Aug', and '9Sep' as keys for their respective months, and save to variable avg_inv_by_month.
- Use the .agg() method to find the average of the total column from the grouped invoices.
- Create a bar chart of avg_inv_by_month.
