Great, you're familiar with what iterables and iterators are! In this exercise, you will reinforce your knowledge about these by iterating over and printing from iterables and iterators.

You are provided with a list of strings flash. You will practice iterating over the list by using a for loop. You will also create an iterator for the list and access the values from the iterator.
