# The keyword nonlocal and nested functions
Let's once again work further on your mastery of scope! In this exercise, you will use the keyword nonlocal within a nested function to alter the value of a variable defined in the enclosing scope.

# Instructions
- Assign to echo_word the string word, concatenated with itself.
- Use the keyword nonlocal to alter the value of echo_word in the enclosing scope.
- Alter echo_word to echo_word concatenated with '!!!'.
- Call the function echo_shout(), passing it a single argument 'hello'.
