# List Methods
Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them. Lists, floats, integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods. In this exercise, you'll be experimenting with:

`index(),` to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input and
`count(),` to get the number of times an element appears in a list.
You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of a house: `areas`.

# Instructions
- Use the `index()` method to get the index of the element in areas that is equal to `20.0.` Print out this index.
- Call `count()` on `areas` to find out how many times `9.50` appears in the list. Again, simply print out this number.
