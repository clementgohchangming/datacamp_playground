# Familiar functions
Out of the box, Python offers a bunch of built-in functions to make your life as a data scientist easier. You already know two such functions: `print()` and `type().` You've also used the functions `str(),` `int(),` `bool()` and `float()` to switch between data types. These are built-in functions as well.

Calling a function is easy. To get the type of `3.0` and store the output as a new variable, `result,` you can use the following:

```python
result = type(3.0)
```

The general recipe for calling functions and saving the result to a variable is thus:

```python
output = function_name(input)
```

# Instructions

- Use `print()` in combination with `type()` to print out the type of var1.
- Use `len()` to get the length of the list `var1` Wrap it in a `print()` call to directly print it out.
- Use `int()` to convert `var2` to an integer. Store the output as `out2`.
