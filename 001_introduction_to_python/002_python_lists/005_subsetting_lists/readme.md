# Subset and conquer

Subsetting Python lists is a piece of cake. Take the code sample below, which creates a list `x` and then selects `"b"` from it. Remember that this is the second element, so it has index 1. You can also use negative indexing.

```python
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1]
x[-3] # same result!
```

Remember the areas list from before, containing both strings and floats? Its definition is already in the script. Can you add the correct code to do some Python subsetting?

# Instructions
- Print out the second element from the `areas` list (it has the value `11.25`).
- Subset and print out the last element of `areas`, being `9.50`. Using a negative index makes sense here!
- Select the number representing the area of the living room (`20.0`) and print it out.
