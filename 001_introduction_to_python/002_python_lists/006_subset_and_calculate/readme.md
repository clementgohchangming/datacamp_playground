# Subset and calculate

After you've extracted values from a list, you can use them to perform additional calculations. Take this example, where the second and fourth element of a list x are extracted. The strings that result are pasted together using the + operator:

```python
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
print(x[1] + x[3])
```

# Instructions

- Using a combination of list subsetting and variable assignment, create a new variable, `eat_sleep_area`, that contains the sum of the area of the kitchen and the area of the bedroom.
- Print the new variable `eat_sleep_area`.
