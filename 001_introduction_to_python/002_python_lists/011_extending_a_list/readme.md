# Extend a list
If you can change elements in a list, you sure want to be able to add elements to it, right? You can use the + operator:

```python
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
y = x + ["e", "f"]
```

You just won the lottery, awesome! You decide to build a poolhouse and a garage. Can you add the information to the `areas` list?

# Instructions
- Use the + operator to paste the list `["poolhouse", 24.5]` to the end of the areas list. Store the resulting list as `areas_1`.
- Further extend `areas_1` by adding data on your garage. Add the string `"garage"` and float `15.45`. Name the resulting list `areas_2`.
