# Your First 2D NumPy Array
Before working on the actual MLB data, let's try to create a 2D `numpy` array from a small list of lists.

In this exercise, `baseball` is a list of lists. The main list contains 4 elements. Each of these elements is a list containing the height and the weight of 4 baseball players, in this order. `baseball` is already coded for you in the script.

# Instructions

- Use `np.array()` to create a 2D numpy array from baseball. Name it `np_baseball`.
- Print out the `type` of `np_baseball`.
- Print out the `shape` attribute of `np_baseball`. Use `np_baseball.shape`.
