# Explore the baseball data
Because the mean and median are so far apart, you decide to complain to the MLB. They find the error and send the corrected data over to you. It's again available as a 2D `Numpy` array `np_baseball`, with three columns.

The Python script in the editor already includes code to print out informative messages with the different summary statistics. Can you finish the job?

# Instructions
- The code to print out the mean height is already included. Complete the code for the median height. Replace `None` with the correct code.
- Use `np.std()` on the first column of `np_baseball` to calculate `stddev`. Replace `None` with the correct code.
- Do big players tend to be heavier? Use `np.corrcoef()` to store the correlation between the first and second column of `np_baseball` in corr. Replace `None` with the correct code.
