# Multiple grouped summaries
Earlier in this chapter, you saw that the .agg() method is useful to compute multiple statistics on multiple variables. It also works with grouped data. NumPy, which is imported as np, has many different summary statistics functions, including: np.min, np.max, np.mean, and np.median.

sales is available and pandas is imported as pd.

# Instructions
- Import numpy with the alias np.
- Get the min, max, mean, and median of weekly_sales for each store type using .groupby() and .agg(). Store this as sales_stats. Make sure to use numpy functions!
- Get the min, max, mean, and median of unemployment and fuel_price_usd_per_l for each store type. Store this as unemp_fuel_stats.
