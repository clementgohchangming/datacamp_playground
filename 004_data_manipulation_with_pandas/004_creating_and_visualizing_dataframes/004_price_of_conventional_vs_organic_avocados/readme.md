# Price of conventional vs. organic avocados
Creating multiple plots for different subsets of data allows you to compare groups. In this exercise, you'll create multiple histograms to compare the prices of conventional and organic avocados.

matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt and pandas has been imported as pd.

# Instructions

Part 1

- Subset avocados for the conventional type, and the average price column. Create a histogram.
- Create a histogram of avg_price for organic type avocados.
- Add a legend to your plot, with the names "conventional" and "organic".
- Show your plot.

Part 2:

Modify your code to adjust the transparency of both histograms to 0.5 to see how much overlap there is between the two distributions.

Part 3:

Modify your code to use 20 bins in both histograms.
